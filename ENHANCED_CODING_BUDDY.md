# Enhanced CodingBuddy - Intelligent GitHub Assistant

## Overview

The CodingBuddy has been significantly enhanced to provide intelligent, natural language interaction with GitHub repositories. Users can now simply tell the assistant what they want to do in plain English, and it will automatically detect the task type, gather necessary information, and execute the appropriate GitHub operations.

## Key Features

### ðŸ§  Intelligent Task Detection
The system automatically detects what type of GitHub task you want to perform based on your natural language input:

- **GitHub Issues**: Create bug reports, feature requests, and other issues
- **List Issues**: View and list existing issues in the repository
- **Pull Requests**: Create and manage pull requests between branches
- **Code Reviews**: Get detailed code analysis and suggestions
- **File Analysis**: Analyze specific files for improvements and best practices
- **Repository Information**: Get detailed repository statistics and information
- **Branch Operations**: Create and manage branches
- **General Questions**: Get development advice and best practices

### ðŸ’¬ Natural Language Processing
- **Smart Parameter Extraction**: Automatically extracts relevant information from your messages
- **Conversation Flow Management**: Intelligently prompts for missing information
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Provides relevant suggestions based on your repository and selected files

### ðŸ”„ Interactive Information Gathering
When the system needs more information, it provides a streamlined interface to collect it:

- **Issue Creation**: Prompts for title, description, and labels
- **File Analysis**: Asks for specific file paths to analyze
- **Pull Requests**: Requests source and target branch names
- **Branch Operations**: Asks for branch names and source branches

## How to Use

### 1. Authentication

"Check the security of the login module"
```

#### Pull Requests
```
"Create a pull request from feature-branch to main"
"Make a PR from my changes to the main branch"
```

#### Branch Operations
```
"Create a new branch called feature-login"
"Make a branch from main called bugfix-123"
```

#### Repository Information
```
"Show me repository stats"
"Tell me about this repository"
"Get repository information"
```

#### General Questions
```
"How do I implement OAuth?"
"What's the best way to structure this project?"
"How can I improve the code quality?"
```
